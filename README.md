Sample Output:
Response: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics principles to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and can be entangled with each other, allowing quantum computers to perform complex calculations much faster than traditional computers for certain types of problems.
Important Notes:

This is a generic example - actual implementation would need:

Correct API endpoint from DeepSeek documentation

Proper authentication method

Supported model names

Appropriate API parameters

You would need to:

Sign up for DeepSeek's developer platform

Obtain an API key

Review their API documentation for exact specifications

Potential error cases to handle:

Invalid API key

Rate limiting

Network errors

Invalid request parameters

For actual implementation, always refer to the official DeepSeek AI API documentation and ensure you comply with their terms of service and usage policies.
